Research and analyze which of the vulnerabilities appear to be related to the code that was deployed for the environment in this project.

AttackInstanceSG:
- 4.1 Ensure no security groups allow ingress from 0.0.0.0/0 to port 22

WebAppSG:
- 4.1 Ensure no security groups allow ingress from 0.0.0.0/0 to port 22
- 4.2 Ensure no security groups allow ingress from 0.0.0.0/0 to port 3389

default:
- 4.3 Ensure the default security group of every VPC restricts all traffic

Bonus - provide recommendations on how to remediate the vulnerabilities.

4.1: Modify the inbound rule for each security group to allow ingress from restricted IPs (in this case my IP) or delete the rule allowing ingress on port 22.

4.2: Modify the inbound rule for each security group to allow ingress from restricted IPs (in this case my IP) or delete the rule allowing ingress on port 3389.

4.3: Delete all inbound and outbound rules from the default security group. Add the required rules to other security groups attached to the vpc.
